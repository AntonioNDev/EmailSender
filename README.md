# EmailSender



Simple email sender with Python.


In main.py there are two variables that take the email and the password from the .env file.

If you want to send email to someone from your gmail account you need to write your own email and password.


EMAIL_ADDR = os.environ.get('EMAIL') #Your email goes here.

EMAIL_PW = os.environ.get('APP_PW') #Your password goes here.
